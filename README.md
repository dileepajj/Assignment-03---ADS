• In this project,  k-means clustering is applied to the plot of CO2 emissions per head in countries in 1990 and 2019. <br /> 
• World bank climate-change data is used in this project. Please download climate-change.csv file from world bank data before running the code.<br /> 
• Two key country groups have been identified, one having similar CO2 emissions per head in both years 1990 and 2019 and the other not.<br /> 
• When forecasting is applied for countries with dissimilar CO2 emissions per head in 1990 and 2019, they tend to have an increasing trend in CO2 emission forecasts with confidence ranges.<br /> 
• Countries with dissimilar CO2 emissions per head in 1990 and 2019 can be clustered into five groups by applying k-means clustering on their forest land and agricultural land percentages in 2019.
